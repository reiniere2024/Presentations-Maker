Hi All,

Are you like me completely disappointed about Microsoft's Powerpoint program?
It was good in the beginning and I used it a lot those days but the last 15
years it just gets bigger and bigger but not better and better.
(actually it gets 'badder' and 'badder' like all office and azure stuff.(lol))

I have made a small dedicated Presentations Maker program that you can use
to quickly make your own presentations and run them for an audience.
The essence of good presentations is presenting text-blocks in sequence,
and not all at the same time, to direct the audience focus.
I have made use of that principle in this program.

I have included a simple tutorial Presentation about Databases so that you
can quickly see how the program works.
I hope you will be able to make good presentations with the program.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
